<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>
Object Oriented C toolkit, or shortly <strong>ooc</strong> has been created with the intention to enable to write object oriented code easily using standard <strong>ANSI-C</strong>, with all the possible type checks. It is very important being ANSI-C compliant, because the main goal was the portability even for systems that lack a C++ compiler. 
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
The other goal was keeping it lightweight, being able to port it onto small computers as well, like embedded systems.
The implementation has a C++ like approach, using <em>classes</em>, <em>objects</em>, and <em>exceptions</em>.
The ooc also incorporates <em>single inheritance</em> and with the help of interfaces and mixins a kind of <em>multiple inheritance</em>.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
There are many similar kits out there, but I found most of them either too complicated for writing a fully controllable, really <em>portable</em> code, or inconvenient to use it for writing readable programs. So I have started from scratch.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
The <strong>ooc</strong> toolkit comes with some container classes, a unit testing helper class and a tool that let's you generate classes from several templates easily.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
In this manual I will cover only issues related to the implementation and use of <strong>ooc</strong>, I assume that the reader is familiar with the Object Oriented Programming and has a good knowledge about C and C++ and their most common internal implementation.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
More detailed information on the use of <strong>ooc</strong> can be found in the ooc API documentation.
